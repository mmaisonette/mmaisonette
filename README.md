## Hi there üëã
I‚Äôm **Marcio Maisonette**, a Platform Engineer passionate about cloud-native technologies, automation, and software development. My focus is on designing and building scalable platforms that empower teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with confidence.

### üöÄ What I Do
- Build developer platforms that simplify workflows and reduce complexity.

- Design CI/CD pipelines that accelerate delivery without compromising quality.

- Automate infrastructure with Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), cloud-native principles, and container orchestration.

- Apply knowledge in cloud computing, networking, storage systems, and databases to design reliable and secure environments.

- Leverage and develop tooling and automation to improve developer experience and system efficiency.

- Collaborate with teams to streamline workflows and reduce friction in delivery pipelines.

- Explore software development in Python and Go, with additional experience in JavaScript.

- Use AI tools to enhance my daily work and productivity.

### üí° Philosophy
For me, **Platform Engineering and Software Development go hand in hand**: one creates the foundation, the other brings ideas to life. I believe in turning complex problems into elegant solutions that make technology more accessible and teams more productive.

I love learning and I believe in the power of continuous learning ‚Äî both for personal growth and for society. I‚Äôm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to shape my skills and mindset, within technology and beyond it.

### üåê Side Projects
- [thecodingmind.dev](https://thecodingmind.dev) ‚Üí A blog where I share articles on software engineering, DevOps practices, and personal insights from my journey.

### üìö Beyond Work
- [secondlevel.me](https://secondlevel.me) ‚Üí A hub linking to other things I explore beyond technology, keeping a personal touch.
