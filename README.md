## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Marcio Maisonette, a Platform Engineer passionate about cloud-native technologies, automation, and software development. My focus is on designing and building scalable platforms that empower teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with confidence.

ðŸš€ What I Do

Build developer platforms that simplify workflows and reduce complexity

Design CI/CD pipelines that accelerate delivery without compromising quality

Automate infrastructure with a focus on cloud-native and container orchestration

Explore software development in Python and Go, always learning and experimenting

ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

For me, Platform Engineering and Software Development go hand in hand: one creates the foundation, the other brings ideas to life. I believe in turning complex problems into elegant solutions that make technology more accessible and teams more productive.

ðŸ“š Beyond Work

I enjoy experimenting with side projects â€” from building CLI tools in Python to writing technical blog posts â€” as a way to keep learning and sharing knowledge with the community.
