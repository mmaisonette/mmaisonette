## Hey! üëã
I‚Äôm **Marcio Maisonette**, a Senior Platform Engineer passionate about cloud-native technologies, automation, and software development.

I use this space to share what I build and explore: platform engineering projects, automation workflows, and side experiments in software development.

### üöÄ What I Do
- Build scalable developer platforms that simplify workflows and reduce complexity.
- Design CI/CD pipelines and tooling that accelerate delivery.
- Implement monitoring and observability to ensure reliability and performance.
- Automate infrastructure with IaC, cloud-native principles, and container orchestration.
- Explore software development in Python and Go, with additional experience in JavaScript and databases.
- Use AI tools to support development, automation, and problem-solving in my daily work.

### üí° Philosophy
I believe in making technology more accessible, reliable, and impactful. For me, 
Platform Engineering and Software Development go hand in hand: one builds the foundation, the other brings ideas to life.

I believe in the power of continuous learning ‚Äî for both personal growth and the progress of society and business. I‚Äôm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and mindset, within technology and beyond it.

I see AI as a valuable ally in this journey, enhancing creativity, accelerating problem-solving, and enabling me to focus on building better platforms.

### üåê My Online Presence
